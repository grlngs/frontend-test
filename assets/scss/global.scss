 * Please try to maintain the following ITCSS structure at all times:
 *
 * 1. Settings ...... Global variables, config switches.
 * 2. Tools ......... Default mixins and functions.
 * 3. Generic ....... Ground-zero styles (resets, box-sizing).
 * 4. Base .......... Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
 * 5. Objects ....... Cosmetic-free design patterns.
 * 6. Components .... Designed components, chunks of UI.
 * 7. Trumps ........ Helpers and overrides.
 *
 * Foundation 6 is included for your convenience.
